"""What a gate verdict records: the shape it holds for, and its memory.

Both are recording, not deciding. ``min_speedup`` is untouched, no new
refusal path exists, and every verdict this produces is the verdict the
gate produced before — with two facts attached that were previously lost:
the shape the measurement was taken at, and what the unit does to resident
memory. A refusal that reads as free may be the most expensive line in a
run, and until it says so that cannot even be discussed.
